# Learn Python from Scratch 🐍

This is my personal journey of learning Python step by step.  
I will upload code day by day as I explore syntax, concepts, and small projects.

- **02** → Syntax, Indentation, and Comments (single-line & multi-line)
- **03** → (will update soon...)

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong Python basics
- Practice daily with small codes
- Share my learning openly on GitHub

## 📌 Note
This repo is mainly for practice and tracking my learning.  
Anyone who is also learning can use it for reference.
